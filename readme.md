notes:

- Very little styling has been applied
- Styles are utilized in 3 ways - my preference is tailwind which has not been used in this project

  - importing css (modules and regular css files)
  - inline

- If you have node A connected to node B and node B connected again to node A, now neither of them can be marked as completed

  - how would I resolve this?

- Starting position could be more meaningful

- Marking incomplete can have different approaches

  - mark everything down the tree incomplete and notify user
  - leave other nodes as is

- What are all the styles in App.css for?
